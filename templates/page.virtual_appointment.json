Then, we'll start sourcing the perfect stones to match your design or custom cut them to fit the aesthetic perfectly. </p><p><br/>If you have an existing piece, this is where we’ll have you share all of the details. From there, we’ll hand design your dream piece for your approval and start work.</p>",

Each custom order requires a completely personalised sketch before a wax model is made to your specifications.</p><p><br/>Occasionally, pieces do not pass a watchful QC process. In that case, we would remake it entirely under your guidance with you along for the journey en route to your dream piece.</p>",

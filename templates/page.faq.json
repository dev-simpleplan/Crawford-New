Lab diamonds are created within a laboratory setting, avoiding the humanitarian and environmental impacts of mined diamonds.</p><p>The growth process for lab-created diamonds mirrors that of mined diamonds. It begins by exposing carbon atoms to high temperatures and immense pressure, which fuse together to construct a crystalline lattice structure. Once the growing process is complete, meticulous cutting and polishing takes place to reveal their utmost brilliance in an array of colour and clarity grades, exactly the same as mined diamonds.</p>"

            "para": "<p>Lab-grown diamonds are produced in a controlled, laboratory environment under two methods: high pressure, high temperature (HPHT) or chemical vapour deposition (CVD).</p><p>HTHP mimics the high pressure and temperature conditions of mined or natural diamond formation in the earth. The process involves placing a diamond seed into pure carbon and exposing it to intense pressure and heat.</p><p>The second and more commonly used lab diamond growth process is Chemical Vapour Deposition. During CVD, a diamond seed is planted in a low-pressure microwave chamber which is then filled with carbon-containing gas. The microwave beam causes carbon to rain from a plasma cloud, growing the diamond layer by layer, and accelerating the natural crystallisation process to within six to ten weeks.</p><p>Like mined diamonds, once lab diamonds are grown they are then cut, polished, and evaluated by a certified gemologist.</p>"

            "para": "<p>Despite their incredible likeness to the eye, moissanite and diamond are made up of two different chemical compounds. Unlike diamonds which are made up of 100% carbon, moissanite is a silicon carbide, sharing similar properties to that of diamond both in structure and appearance.</p><p>Like diamond, moissanite is amongst the strongest materials known, surpassing all other precious gemstones besides diamond. The hardness or scratch resistance of a gemstone is measured on the “Mohs' scale”, where moissanite is 2nd only to diamond.</p><p>What sets moissanite apart is its remarkable ability to refract and reflect more light than diamonds, resulting in heightened fire and brilliance that surpasses even the diamond's sparkle. Just like diamonds, moissanite maintains its enduring lustre and doesn't diminish over time.</p>"

            "para": "<p>In the realm of the 4Cs, colour takes the second most crucial role, denoting the absence of colour within a diamond. While diamonds showcase an assortment of hues, entirely colourless white diamonds are an exception, as most possess a very faint undertone of yellow. The closer a white diamond moves to absolute colourlessness, the rarer and more valuable it becomes.</p><p>Beginning at D to signify colourlessness, the scale proceeds alphabetically downwards. Diamonds ranked from D to J maintain transparency on the scale, fitting into the category of colourless to near colourless. Beyond J, a faint hint of pale yellow becomes perceptible.</p><p>Colour significantly impacts a diamond's overall visual allure. Crawford Stone Company only offers diamonds within the D to J range on the colour scale, consisting of colourless and near-colourless variations. Differentiating between colour variations within this range is quite challenging without a direct side-by-side comparison.</p>",

The lower the number of imperfections, the higher the clarity grade.</p><p>Diamonds that have a clarity grade of “Flawless” (F) rank the highest and are extremely rare, containing no inclusions. “Internally Flawless” (IF) follow “Flawless” in ranking and are also extremely rare.<br>After these high rankings, diamonds are graded as “Very, Very Slightly Included” (VVS1 and VVS2), as well as “Very Slightly Included” (VS1 and VS2) with the grading of 1 denoting a slightly higher degree of clarity.</p>",

Diamond size refers to the measurements of the diamond such as the height and width whereas diamond carat is the diamond’s weight. While a higher carat weight means a bigger diamond, the visible ratio isn’t necessarily 1:1 — a diamond that is 2 carats won’t necessarily be double the visible size of a 1 carat diamond depending on the stone shape and cut.</p>",
